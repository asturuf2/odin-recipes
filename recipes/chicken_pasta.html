    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil, salt it generously, and cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Reserve a bit of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pan, then add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the chicken breast and cook it for 5-6 minutes until slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Add the shallot and garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Next, add the smoked paprika, onion granules, dried oregano, ground black pepper and cayenne pepper and stir to combine.</li>

        <li>Transfer the pasta to the pan and stir to combine. Add a splash of pasta water if it looks too thick.</li>
        <li>Next, stir in the grated parmesan and fresh parsley. Divide the pasta into bowls and serve with extra parmesan on top if you like.</li>
